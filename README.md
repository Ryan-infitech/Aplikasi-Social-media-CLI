# Python Social Media Application in CLI-Ubuntu Environment

This is a college project aimed at creating a social media application based on Command Line Interface (CLI) on the Ubuntu operating system. The project is developed using the Python programming language and is connected to a MySQL database to support structured data storage.

The application provides basic social media features, such as:

- User registration and login.
- Creation and management of posts.
- Like/comment system on each post.
- Messaging for user interaction.

The project is designed with a modular approach and utilizes Python libraries such as mysql-connector to manage database connections. All operations are executed through a terminal-based interface, making the application lightweight and suitable for implementation in server-based or local environments with limited resources.

This project is expected to provide a deeper understanding of the integration between Python and MySQL, relational data management, and CLI-based application development in a Linux/Ubuntu environment.
